# Release History

## [Unreleased]

- Added durable chat history ownership and opaque agent-session persistence without duplicating provider- or service-owned transcripts.
- Hardened durable-agent duplicate delivery, correlation validation, working-state rollback, and stale-safe TTL deletion scheduling.
- Fixed `ConfigureDurableAgents` and `ConfigureDurableWorkflows` ignoring the `workerBuilder` or `clientBuilder` supplied to a later call when no earlier call supplied one, so the Durable Task worker and client are now registered whichever configuration call provides them. The first non-null delegate wins; later ones are still ignored so a builder passed to several calls is only applied once. Registering an agent that a workflow already referenced now promotes it to an explicitly registered agent instead of throwing, so agents and workflows can be configured in either order ([#67](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework-durable-extension/pull/67))
- [BREAKING] Fixed `AddWorkflow` silently overwriting an existing workflow registered under the same name, which left the workflow and executor registries inconsistent. Registering a different workflow under a name that is already taken now throws, while re-registering the same workflow instance remains a no-op. An application that registers duplicate workflow names starts today but will now fail at startup ([#66](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework-durable-extension/pull/66))
- Fixed a `JsonTypeInfo metadata ... was not provided` failure when persisting agent state for function calls or results that carry values the state serializer has no metadata for, such as the `AIContent` results returned by MCP tools ([#57](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework-durable-extension/pull/57))
- [BREAKING] Added `IWorkflowClient` overloads that start a registered workflow by name, and made workflow result deserialization case-insensitive so results can be read back when hosted in Azure Functions. External implementations of `IWorkflowClient` must implement the new members, and an untyped `null` first argument is now ambiguous between the `Workflow` and workflow-name overloads ([#48](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework-durable-extension/pull/48))
- [BREAKING] Removed the `AddAIAgents` and `AddWorkflows` bulk registration APIs and changed `AddWorkflow` to return `DurableWorkflowOptions` so multiple workflows can be registered fluently ([#39](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework-durable-extension/pull/39))
- Use "session" instead of "thread" terminology in documentation and API comments ([#47](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework-durable-extension/pull/47))
- Wrap RequestPort external responses in a controlled `DurableExecutorOutput` envelope so that only the `result` property is populated during deserialization ([#20](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework-durable-extension/pull/20))
- Bound the live workflow status to a trailing event window so multi-executor workflows with large typed outputs no longer overflow the Durable Task 16&#160;KB custom status cap ([#6775](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/pull/6775))
- Fixed `WorkflowOutputEvent` streaming deserialization to read `executorId` instead of the renamed `sourceId` property, with fallback for backward compatibility ([#6896](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/pull/6896))
- Fix issue with resuming checkpoint after package version upgrade ([#6670](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/pull/6670))
- Bind MCP threadId to the current agent and guard cross-agent session dispatch ([#6531](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/pull/6531))
- Added support for durable workflows ([#4436](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/pull/4436))
- Added support for `AddSwitch` and target-selecting fan-out edges in the durable workflow runner ([#6749](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/pull/6749))
